                                And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
                                If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
                                To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.</p>

                            <p class="speech">Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
                                    Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
                                    And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.</p>

                            <p class="speech">Then you are quite ready for temptation,
                                    And bare skin makes on you a big impression.
                                    I truly don't know why you feel such passion;
                                    I myself think lust is out of fashion,
                                    For I could see you nude from top to toe
                                    Without your pelt setting my cheeks aglow.</p>

                                    Or I must leave you instantly perforce.</p>

                            <p class="speech">No, it is I who will leave you here in peace,
                                    And I will just say this before I cease:
                                    Madam is coming down to visit you
                                    And demands the favor of a rendezvous.</p>

                            <p class="speech">Isn't he sweet!
                                    I'm even surer now that dog's in heat.</p>

                            <p class="speech">Will she soon come?</p>

                            <p class="speech">I think I can hear her.
                                    Yes, there.  Now I will leave you two together.</p>
